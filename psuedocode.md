How to build out this app:

From the user perspective: 
AS a user
WHEN I visit the site
THEN I am presented with a brief description of the Titanomachy 
WHEN I click the play button
THEN I am presented with two sets of cards: one facing me (Olympians) and one facing away (Titans)
THEN I am prompted to choose my team of three Olympians
WHEN I have chosen my fighters
THEN I am prompted to choose two face-down Titan cards without seeing them
IF my chosen Titan cards contain either Prometheus, Themis, a Cyclops, or a Hecatonchire
THEN they fight for my side
WHEN I click "begin battle"
THEN my Titan opponent cards are revealed, scores are calculated, and the winner is declared
