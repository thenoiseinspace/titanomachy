# Titanomachy
This is an original game I created based on the ancient Greek epic of the Titanomachy, or the war between the Titans and the Olympic gods. I am designing the gameplay to reflect the Hesiodic tradition, and am building it using HTML, CSS with Bootstrap, and JavaScript with jQuery. 

User story:  
AS a user
WHEN I visit the site
THEN I am presented with a brief description of the Titanomachy 
WHEN I click the play button
THEN I am presented with two sets of cards: one facing me (Olympians) and one facing away (Titans)
THEN I am prompted to choose my team of three Olympians
WHEN I have chosen my fighters
THEN I am prompted to choose two face-down Titan cards without seeing them
IF my chosen Titan cards contain either Prometheus, Themis, a Cyclops, or a Hecatonchire
THEN they fight for my side
WHEN I click "begin battle"
THEN my Titan opponent cards are revealed, scores are calculated, and the winner is declared
